From the pie chart we are able to determine that the vast majority of the crimes fall within 10
categories which constitute for over 91% of all crimes committed between 2020 and 2021.

As we extract the top 10 crimes commited for this time frame, we can continue to see an uneven
distribution of the top 10 crimes. From the list we see that there are 3 types of crimes that may
be similar.  Theft is considered to be taking property from a building, pick-pocketing, retail theft,
and both theft of under and over $500. Robbery is considered to be armed with a weapon or by physical
force. Burglary is considered to be unlawful and/or forcible entry. We can see that from theft to 
 criminal damage, there is a sharp decline in number of occurances and it continues to decline.
